# SVG Logo Generator

## Description
This project allows users to generate a custom logo in the form of an SVG file by answering a series of prompts. Users provide up to three characters of text, choose a shape (circle, triangle, or square), and specify colors for both the text and the shape. Based on their input, the program creates an SVG logo file that combines the chosen shape with the text, applying the specified colors. The generated SVG file can be opened in a browser or used in web development projects.
